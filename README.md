# Salary Prediction LinearRegression and Using Modules Like word2Number,Pickle,JobLib

## Overview

This simple small project utilizes linear regression to predict salary based on three key factors: 'experience,' 'test_score_out_of_10,' and 'interview_score_out_of_10.' We employ Python's machine learning libraries to create and train the predictive model. Additionally, we use Pickle and JobLib modules to save the model, enabling easy reusability. This project serves as an example of leveraging machine learning for practical tasks like salary estimation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project, named "hiring.csv," contains information about job candidates, including their years of experience, test scores out of 10, interview scores out of 10, and their corresponding salaries in dollars. The goal of this project is to build a linear regression model that can predict salaries based on these factors.
