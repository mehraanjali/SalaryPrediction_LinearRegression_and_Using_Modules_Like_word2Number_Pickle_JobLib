# Salary Prediction LinearRegression and Using Modules Like word2Number,Pickle,JobLib

This simple small project utilizes linear regression to predict salary based on three key factors: 'experience,' 'test_score_out_of_10,' and 'interview_score_out_of_10.' We employ Python's machine learning libraries to create and train the predictive model. Additionally, we use Pickle and JobLib modules to save the model, enabling easy reusability. This project serves as an example of leveraging machine learning for practical tasks like salary estimation.
